# Background
After having used countless services, some not even intended for this use, I became fed up and decided to build my own. Echo is meant to be simply designed, but still retaining the power to foster communities based on shared ideals, to be highly indexed (and therefore easily search-able), and implement machine learning to help users find new quotes that could potentially change their outlook on life.

# The Challenge
Create an application that solves the problem implied in the [background](#background).

# How It Fixed Itself
