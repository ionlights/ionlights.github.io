## Background
For 10 months (about 10 hours a week), during my undergrad, I worked in the [Biomedical Acoustics Research Laboratory (BARL)](http://mae.ucf.edu/BARL) at the University of Central Florida &mdash; to determine if my pursuit of biomedical engineering was a well founded one.

While I was at the BARL, I found that biomedical engineering, at least for now, is more of a hobbyist interest than a life-long passion; but here's the presentation of the project where I led a team of three developers.

## The Challenge
Collecting and analyzing signals for research, medical, and other purposes requires the use of desktop computers or laptops, both of which aren't near as portable as phones or tablets. This presents a problem of an inability to analyze signals in their most natural of habitats if these habitats don't support the access laptops and desktops need.

<br>

## The Solution
Given the advances experienced in my lifetime, phones and tablets are approaching the levels of low-powered laptops, which makes for a ripe opportunity to design a mobile application that has a variety of necessary analytical features to extract information from signals, while aspiring to achieve a very minimal loss in usability of such algorithms with the lower resources mobile devices have.
