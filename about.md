Currently, I'm a student and beginning a process of life-long accelerated learning (also known as entrepreneurship). Computer Science, Cognitive Science, and Intelligent Robotics are the academic studies, while human-computer interaction is the life-long study. Both of these are happening *at* the University of Central Florida, but the latter is really happening at [Axcelion](http://axcelion.com/), as a start-up built on advancing how humans, technology, and the rest of Earth get along, in a technologically symbiotic relationship.

I suggest taking a gander at projects I've either worked on, led, or built-solo by heading over to [Builds](/builds) or taking a look at my [Résumé]().
